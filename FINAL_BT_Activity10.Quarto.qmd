## Question 1

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

myFunction <- function(x) {
  y <- (cos(4 * x) + tan(0.5 * x))^4
  return(y)
}

# Plot the function
ggplot() +
  stat_function(
    fun = myFunction,
    xlim = c(0, 1),
    n = 1000
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "x",
    y = "h(x)"
  )

```

## Question 2

```{r}
# Example of a recreated plot
library(ggplot2)

# Create a scatter plot using the diamonds dataset
ggplot(data = ggplot2::diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Prices by Carat and Cut",
    x = "Carat",
    y = "Price"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Question 3

```{r}
